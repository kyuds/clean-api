# clean-api
A simple developer profile REST API based on the CLEAN architecture paradigm.

### Installation and Quick Start
Run the following commands in the directory where the code should be installed. 
```
git clone https://github.com/kyuds/clean-api.git
cd clean-api
npm install
```
Run `npm run start` to start the server. 

### RESTful Features
Currently, requests are not processed, so the callback will return a 404 error.
